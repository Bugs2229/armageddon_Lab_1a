# Armageddon Lab_1a (click ops)
**Lab Summary**
* Build a classic AWS cloud application architecture
* Use an **Amazon EC2 instance** as the compute layer
* Use an **Amazon RDS database** as the managed relational database
* Configure **secure EC2-to-RDS connectivity** using **VPC networking + Security Groups**
* Store/manage database credentials using **AWS Secrets Manager**
* Deploy a simple app that **writes to and reads from the database**

**Short answers:**

A) Why is DB inbound source restricted to the EC2 security group? 

`It prevents the database from being reachable by any other device that doesn't need access. It is best practice to protect your database (Tea app!)`

B) What port does MySQL use? `TCP Port 3306`

C) Why is Secrets Manager better than storing creds in code/user-data?

`Secrets Manager prevents credentials from being exposed from your systems and replaces them with secure, controlled, auditable secret retrieval at runtime.`
